Python Fundamental II Lectures:
  Stringss: 
  Contain text, made up of character, therefore they are a container data type
  No character data type in python, but there are strings of length 1
  Strings are ordered sequences (cat vs act)
  Python strings use Unicode, represent letters from almost all writing systems can be used in python strings
  String literals:
    Literal - fixed value in a program (use quotes around it '', "", '''''', """""")
    Tripe quoted string can have line breaks - often used in Doc Strings
  String concatenation:
    Use the + operator to put strings together
  Accessing individual characters:
    Each character in a string has an index, starting at 0
    Use [] to access the individual characters (known as the index operator)
    Index can be negative, counting from the end of the string (0, 1, 2) is (-3, -2, -1)
  Accessing slices:
    Use the index operator to slice strings, format is different
    Two ways to do it - str[start:stop] or str[start:stop:step]
    Slice will include start but exclude the stop
    Using negative values will give you the reverse string
  Formulated string literals (f-strings):
    A way to plug values into string literals
    Contains {} expressions with results of an expression (basically plug things in to a phrase)
    f"{name} is a {job}" -> always start with an f then a quote
    Each {} is evaluated and converted to a string
